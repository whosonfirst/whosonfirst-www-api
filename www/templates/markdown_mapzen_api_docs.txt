<a name="intro"></a>
The Mapzen Places API allows developers (and robots) programmatic access to query and retrieve Who's On First data via a [REST-ish](#cgi) interface.

API methods are dispatched over `HTTP` with one or more query parameters and data is returned in response as [JSON](formats.md#json) by default but you may also specify [CSV](formats.md#csv) or Who's On First's own [meta](formats.md#meta) formatted responses for certain [API methods](methods.md).

The endpoint for the Mapzen Places API is: **[https://places.mapzen.com/v1/](https://places.mapzen.com/v1/)**

_If you're wondering the chances that there will ever be a `/v2` are slim-to-never._

All errors are returned using [HTTP status codes](errors.md) in the `400-599` range.

`400` class errors mean the problem was on your end and `500` class errors mean the problem was our fault.

### Caveats

The API is not feature complete yet, which is to say it will keep growing as time goes by. The easiest way to think about the Mapzen Places API is to look at the Who's On First [Spelunker](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/) website and imagine that anything you can do there to search and navigate all those places should also be possible via the API. As of this writing it is not but we'll get there. If there is anything currently missing that you'd like or need to do sooner than later [send up a flare](https://twitter.co/alloftheplaces) and we'll see about adding it to the list.

Some API methods are flagged as being `experimental` which means that both either their inputs or their outputs _may_ change without warning. We'll try not to introduce any backwards incompatible changes but you should approach these API methods defensively.
